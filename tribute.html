        <p id="tribute-info">Vincent Van Gogh was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who lived in the 19th century. He is known for his colorful and expressive artworks, which often depict landscapes, still life, and portraits. Despite struggling with mental illness throughout his life, Van Gogh created over 2,000 works of art in just a decade, including some of the most recognizable paintings in the world, such as "The Starry Night" and "Sunflowers." His unique style of using bold brushstrokes and vivid colors had a significant impact on the development of modern art. Although he was not recognized during his lifetime, Van Gogh's legacy continues to influence artists and inspire people around the world.</p>
